# Day-Planner

## Description
The **Day-Planner** project is the fourth homework assignment of the March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

Allowing us to use the skills covered in this week's course, this project was created to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

This project also includes Bootstrap, uses of local storage, and CSS animation. 

## User Story
 -  AS AN employee with a busy schedule
 - I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
 - SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
